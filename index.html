            <h1>Hi, I'm Hanz Christian Emmanuel Catibayan</h1>
            <h3>ICT Student</h3>
            <p>I am currently studying at Bucal National Integrated School
                 and the strand I took is ICT Animation, although it has
                  nothing to do with Programming, I really became interested
                   in coding. When I was in Grade 10 in Junior High School In
                    MNHS, we studied ICT-CSS or Computer System Servicing, which
                     is why it was all about the System Unit or Computer and networking.
                      I'm just starting to learn coding and the first thing I'm learning
                       is HTML and CSS. I expect that I will learn a lot more and improve
                        here because in the future the course I will take is BSIT. That's
                         why if you are one of the students like me who is studying Programming,
                          just keep learning and learning until you perfect this skill. You can 
                          talk to me if you have time, and together we will learn programming so 
                          that I can offer my knowledge and you can contribute what you know. Thank you!</p>
